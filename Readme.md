# DarkwoodCustomizer

DarkwoodCustomizer is a versatile mod that lets you tailor nearly every aspect of your Darkwood experience. From item tweaks to crafting recipes, character stats, and more, this mod offers deep customization options that allow you to fine-tune the game to your preferences.

With comprehensive documentation for every configuration option, the mod is easy to navigate and modify. Most settings stay true to the vanilla game by default, but a few key changes include:

- Recovering materials when disarming traps
- Custom Items added, including unused content
- Lantern repair functionality
- Expanded workbench inventory (9x12)

## WARNING

By default, this mod will **remove excess slots** from your inventory or storage! If your current inventory or storage size exceeds what’s set in the mod, those extra slots will be removed unless you disable this config option.

Another important warning: **Check the config before loading your save!** If any items or inventory slots are missing, make sure not to save the game (don’t interact with characters, progress, or pass a day). Simply exit the game and increase your inventory or storage slots to avoid losing items.

Explore the config files to unlock the full potential of the mod and craft your perfect Darkwood experience!
